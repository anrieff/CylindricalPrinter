Electronics for the cylindrical printer
==

The electronics will include the following, mounted in some semi-professional-looking manner.

* a power strip with a long cord
* the 12 volt switching supply
* the stepper controller
* the Arduino board
* 4-position terminal strip: A+, A-, B+, B-

I also need the projector, obviously.

Early on, I had trouble getting the stepper motor to work correctly, and so while printing that octohedron, I
rotated by hand the threaded rod that lowered the build platform into the liquid. Since then I've gotten the
stepper motor to behave with the following pieces. This was a big source of frustration; two or three other
stepper drivers didn't work out.

* CNC Single Axis TB6600 Stepper Controller, part number HY-DIV268N-5A (check Alibaba.com or Aliexpress.com)
* LIHUA 120W (12v, 10 amp) Regulated Switching Power Supply (also see Alibaba.com, Aliexpress.com)
* NEMA-23 motor, part number
  [266-F4.2A-1](http://www.hubbardcnc.com/index.php?main_page=product_info&products_id=362),
  125 oz-in, possibly overkill

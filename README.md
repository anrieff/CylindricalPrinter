Cylindrical Printer
==

The early ugly prototype was built during June and July 2014 and was the one on which I made my first successful 3D print,
an octohedral shape made with green SubGPlus from MakerJuice.

I needed to change the design of this thing and it will look distinctly less cylindrical when I'm done.

Maybe it should be renamed to "Steampunk Stereolithographic Printer".

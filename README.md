Cylindrical Printer
==

The early ugly prototype was built during June and July 2014 and was the one on which I made my first successful 3D print,
an octohedral shape made with green SubGPlus from MakerJuice. This was my proof to myself that I had a good enough handle
on the basic principles to invest more time and energy.

The design evolved over time. I wanted to make it kind of steampunk-ish with lots of gears and widgets, but still simple
enough to build that it could be accomplished by a horribly bad craftsperson like myself.

While I've been doing this, I've been blogging and occasionally posting Youtube videos.

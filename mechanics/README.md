Mechanics for the cylindrical printer
==

I'm not a mechanical genius and I'm a laughably bad craftsman. An important
design goal of this set of mechanics is that anybody should be able to build it
without being a highly skilled craftsperson.

I wasted a lot of time trying to make gears on a laser cutter, and finally
gave up because the laser cutter wasn't repeatable and reliable with the
kind of plywood I could easily buy from a hardware store.

So instead I'm using bicycle chain and 3d-printed sprockets. To build this
printer you will need some of these sprockets. If you have a friend with a 3d
printer, they can print them for you. Otherwise you can go to a service bureau
such as Shapeways or Sculpteo and they can print them.

Once your printer is built, you can print sprockets (and maybe other parts)
for yourself and other people.

At some point I will post some assembly videos on Youtube. Not there yet.

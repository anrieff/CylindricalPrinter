The printer design has been through a number of revisions. The most recent change was that
there had been a mirror above the bucket allowing the projector to rest horizontally on a
table. It turned out the mirror didn't reflect UV light well enough, and had to be removed
from the optical path, so the projector needed to be positioned directly above the bucket
pointing downwards.

There is also one picture where I was trimming sprocket teeth to get smoother motion of the
bike chain. The improved sprocket design is now posted to Thingiverse, or if you're lazy
you can order it on my Shapeways store.

The printer that I will exhibit at Maker Faire NYC 2014 may have a few trivial tweaks
beyond what you see here. The projector support is bulky and I'd like something sleeker.
But this is basically it.
